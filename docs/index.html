        <h3 class="mt-5">What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Voyage Privé Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, 
          called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use three rings with the following semantics:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-justify">
          <li>
            <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in 
            large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our Voyage Privé production environment, low risk and 
            recommended to be widely used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to 
            solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. 
            TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and 
            will share knowledge and experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that 
            we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, 
            but usually can be continued for existing projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 px-3">
        <h3 class="mt-5">What is the purpose?</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Voyage Privé to pick the best technologies 
          for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on 
          technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the 
          <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets 
          out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we 
          think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Principal Engineers</em> &mdash; who faciliate and drive the 
          technology selection discussions at Zalando across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies 
          to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is 
          open for contribution for all Engineering teams at Zalando and depends on their active participation 
          to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br/>
        </p>

          information on how we approach Technology Selection and use the Tech Radar at Zalando.
